## Harness — `task-*` edge enforcement (rescoped)

Source: `docs/design/task-graph-audit.md`, re-scored in `docs/design/harness-altitude-audit.md`.
Each edge is scored on three questions — **Silent** (invisible to the orchestrator at its next
decision point), **Costly** (damage survives the session: lands on `main`/remote, corrupts tracked
state, or burns a resource a re-run does not reclaim), **Decidable** (a file or exit code settles
it). 3/3 ships; 2/3 ships only if the residual failure is unbounded; 0–1/3 is ceremony.

Cut items and their re-file bars live in `docs/design/harness-altitude-audit.md` →
*Cut — do not re-file without new evidence*. Nothing from this group is queued.

### PR #254 — memory-guard follow-ups

- [ ] [FEAT] Gate shell-based memory writes in `memory-guard` — the hook matches `Write|Edit` only, so `printf ... > ~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/note.md` writes ungated; `commit-guard`'s PreToolUse(Bash) static command analysis is the precedent to follow *(deferred: no shell-path memory write has been observed; the other four PR #254 follow-ups shipped without it in PR for 4.9.6 — revisit against a recorded case)*
